# SystemWebpack - Webpack dev server support for System.Web (old ASP.NET)
It is very nice that we have ASP.NET Core, and got nice toys to play with like built-in support for the Webpack dev server. But what about System.Web? So many projects are still built on the old ASP.NET framework, where we don't have Webpack dev server support.

This library aims to fix that. This library provides support for Webpack in System.Web projects.

## Features

Support for:
- Webpack dev middleware
- Hot module reloading

Used for development purposes only.

## Building the project
To build the project ensure you have:

- .NET Framework 4.5.2 or higher installed
- Visual Studio with Web Development tools
